# Batista-WebDev-portfolio

## Description 

This project was to create my first web developer's portfolio as a responsive webpage, in order to showcase the work that has been completed on bootcamp thus far. 

Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

-When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you.
-When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
-When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications.
-When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
-When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application.
-When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.

Contributions were as follows: 
- HTML and CSS file was created which includes a semantic HTML coding structure, CSS flexbox features and media queries. 
- Structure of HTML was carried out in a verticle/column design due to difficulties surrounding grid template. 
- 'alt' attributes were given to each image tag.
- A re-organisation of CSS in order to match HTML.
- Additional comments were made for clarity and structure.



## Installation 




The website is now deployed and live and can be accessed via any browser (Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox).

In order to see the media query features, with the use of the developer tools feature or right clicking 'inspect' on the portfolio webpage can give you access to see how webpage can be viewed on multiple devices.
